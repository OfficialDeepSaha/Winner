# Final Fixes Applied to Smart Todo List Application

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Authentication Token Configuration ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Missing `rest_framework.authtoken` in Django INSTALLED_APPS
**Fix**: Added `'rest_framework.authtoken'` to INSTALLED_APPS and ran migrations
**Result**: Token authentication now working properly

### 2. CORS Configuration ✅ FIXED  
**Issue**: Frontend React dev server (port 5173) not included in CORS allowed origins
**Fix**: Updated Django settings to include:
```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",  # Next.js default port
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "http://localhost:5173",  # Vite React dev server
    "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
]
```
**Result**: CORS issues resolved

### 3. API Service Authentication ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Health check endpoint requiring authentication
**Fix**: Updated health check method to bypass authentication
**Result**: Health endpoint accessible without token

### 4. Frontend Token Management ✅ VERIFIED
**Issue**: Frontend API service properly handles authentication tokens
**Status**: API service correctly implemented with token management
**Result**: All API calls include proper Authorization headers

## Test Results After Fixes

### Backend API Testing ✅ ALL WORKING
- Health endpoint: `GET /health/` → 200 OK
- API root: `GET /api/` → 200 OK with endpoint listing
- Dashboard with auth: `GET /api/dashboard/` → 200 OK with data
- All CRUD endpoints functional
